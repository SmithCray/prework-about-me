      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Cray Smith and id like to tell you a little bit about myself and the goals I am here to achieve.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Loveland Colorado.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy various hobbies including video games, motorcycles and trail riding, Magic The Gathering and much more...</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>When I think of my dream job I imagine working for a big name video game company and helping to produce AAA titles.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Longmont Colorado.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>At this point in my life I am looking to change my future and pursue a better one. Most of my life I have worked hard 
        labor jobs with no real future or career in sight and thats why I am here to challenge myself in a field I have always 
        feared and been amazed by. In the end I hope to acheive not only a career but the confidence and drive to reach for 
        all my goals throughout my life.</p>
